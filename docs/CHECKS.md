# caditor checks

Tests, CI and tooling that are missing or need attention.

Entries are tagged and ordered as `ROADMAP.md` describes.

- [high · medium · blocked by: the Autodesk app (`DECISIONS.md`)] The Fusion 360 calls follow
  Autodesk's published documentation and are tested against JSON of the shapes it describes
  (`caditor-cloud`'s `fusion/tests.rs`), never against Autodesk's servers with a registered app.
  With one, run once a sign-in, a team hub with several projects, a nested folder, a conversion
  and a download of a large design, and keep any shape that differs as a test.
